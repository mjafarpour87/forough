An interface to interact with NLP-based chat bot

## Project Overview
The ChatterBot library combines language corpora, text processing, machine learning algorithms, and data storage and retrieval to allow you to build flexible chatbots.
You can build an industry-specific chatbot by training it with relevant data. Additionally, the chatbot will remember user responses and continue building its internal graph structure to improve the responses that it can give.
### Attention

While ChatterBot is still a popular open source solution for building a chatbot in Python, it hasnâ€™t been actively maintained for a while and has therefore accumulated a significant number of issues.

There are multiple forks of the project that implement fixes and updates to the existing codebase, but youâ€™ll have to personally pick the fork that implements the solution youâ€™re looking for and then install it directly from GitHub. A fork might also come with additional installation instructions.

To get started, however, you wonâ€™t use a fork. Instead, youâ€™ll use a specific pinned version of the library, as distributed on PyPI. Youâ€™ll find more information about installing ChatterBot in step one.


## Prerequsites

Before you get started, make sure that you have a Python version available that works for this ChatterBot project. What version of Python you need depends on your operating system:

### Windows
  You need to use a Python version below 3.8 to successfully work with the recommended version of ChatterBot in this tutorial. You can install Python 3.7.9 using pyenv-win.
### Linux
  You should be able to run the project on Ubuntu Linux with a variety of Python versions. However, if you bump into any issues, then you can try to install Python 3.7.9, for example using pyenv.
### Mac OS
  You can run the project with a variety of Python versions. The chatbot was built and tested with Python 3.10.7 but should also run with older Python versions.

If youâ€™ve installed the right Python version for your operating system, then youâ€™re ready to get started.

## Step 1: Create a Chatbot Using Python ChatterBot
In this step, youâ€™ll set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. Youâ€™ll also create a working command-line chatbot that can reply to youâ€”but it wonâ€™t have very interesting replies for you yet.

To get started with your chatbot project, create and activate a virtual environment, then install chatterbot and pytz:
### Windows

  ```
  PS> python -m venv venv
  PS> venv\Scripts\activate
 (venv) PS> python -m pip install chatterbot==1.0.4 pytz
 ```
 ### Linux & Mac OS
 ```
 $ python -m venv venv
 $ source venv/bin/activate
 (venv) $ python -m pip install chatterbot==1.0.4 pytz
```
 
 Running these commands in your terminal application installs ChatterBot and its dependencies into a new Python virtual environment.
 After the installation is complete, running <code>python -m pip freeze </code> should bring up list of installed dependencies thatâ€™s similar to what you can find in the provided codeâ€™s <code>requirements.txt</code> file.
 
 With the installation out of the way, and ignoring some of the issues that the library currently has, youâ€™re ready to get started! Create a new Python file, call it bot.py, and add the code that you need to get a basic chatbot up and running:
 ```
 # bot.py


from chatterbot import ChatBot


chatbot = ChatBot("Chatpot")


exit_conditions = (":q", "quit", "exit")

while True:

    query = input("> ")

    if query in exit_conditions:

        break

    else:

        print(f"ðŸª´ {chatbot.get_response(query)}")
```
After importing ChatBot in line 3, you create an instance of ChatBot in line 5. The only required argument is a name, and you call this one "Chatpot". No, thatâ€™s not a typoâ€”youâ€™ll actually build a chatty flowerpot chatbot in this tutorial! Youâ€™ll soon notice that pots may not be the best conversation partners after all.
In line 8, you create a <code>while</code> loop thatâ€™ll keep looping unless you enter one of the exit conditions defined in line 7. Finally, in line 13, you call <code>.get_response()</code> on the ChatBot instance that you created earlier and pass it the user input that you collected in line 9 and assigned to <code>query</code>.
When you run this script, ChatterBot might download some data and language models associated with the [NLTK project](https://realpython.com/python-nltk-sentiment-analysis/). Itâ€™ll print some information about that to your console. Python wonâ€™t download this data again during subsequent runs.
### Note

The NLTK project installs the data that ChatterBot uses into a default location on your operating system:
```
    Windows: C:\nltk_data\
    Linux: /usr/share/nltk_data/
    macOS: /Users/<username>/nltk_data/
```

NLTK will automatically create the directory during the first run of your chatbot.
If youâ€™re ready to communicate with your freshly homegrown Chatbot, then you can go ahead and run the Python file:

```
$ python bot.py
```
fter the language models are set up, youâ€™ll see the greater than sign (>) that you defined in bot.py as your input prompt. You can now start to interact with your chat bot.
Even if your chat bot doesnâ€™t have much to say yet, itâ€™s already learning and growing. To test this out, stop the current session. You can do this by typing one of the exit conditionsâ€”":q", "quit", or "exit". Then start the chatbot another time. Enter a different message, and youâ€™ll notice that the chatbot remembers what you typed during the previous run.

During the first run, ChatterBot created a SQLite database file where it stored all your inputs and connected them with possible responses. There should be three new files that have popped up in your working directory:
```
./
â”œâ”€â”€ bot.py
â”œâ”€â”€ db.sqlite3
â”œâ”€â”€ db.sqlite3-shm
â””â”€â”€ db.sqlite3-wal
```
ChatterBot uses the default <code>SQLStorageAdapter</code> and creates a [SQLite file database](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/blob/1.0/chatterbot/storage/sql_storage.py#L31) unless you specify a different [storage adapter] (https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/storage/index.html).

### Note
The main database file is <code>db.sqlite3</code>, while the other two, ending with <code>-wal</code> and <code>-shm</code>, are temporary support files.

Because you said both hello and hi at the beginning of the chat, your chat-pot learned that it can use these messages interchangeably. That means if you chat a lot with your new chatbot, itâ€™ll gradually have better replies for you. But improving its responses manually sounds like a long process!

Now that youâ€™ve created a working command-line chatbot, youâ€™ll learn how to train it so you can have slightly more interesting conversations.
