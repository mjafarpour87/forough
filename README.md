An interface to interact with NLP-based chat bot

## Project Overview
The ChatterBot library combines language corpora, text processing, machine learning algorithms, and data storage and retrieval to allow you to build flexible chatbots.
You can build an industry-specific chatbot by training it with relevant data. Additionally, the chatbot will remember user responses and continue building its internal graph structure to improve the responses that it can give.
### Attention

While ChatterBot is still a popular open source solution for building a chatbot in Python, it hasn’t been actively maintained for a while and has therefore accumulated a significant number of issues.

There are multiple forks of the project that implement fixes and updates to the existing codebase, but you’ll have to personally pick the fork that implements the solution you’re looking for and then install it directly from GitHub. A fork might also come with additional installation instructions.

To get started, however, you won’t use a fork. Instead, you’ll use a specific pinned version of the library, as distributed on PyPI. You’ll find more information about installing ChatterBot in step one.
