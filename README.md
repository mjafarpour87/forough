An interface to interact with NLP-based chat bot

## Project Overview
The ChatterBot library combines language corpora, text processing, machine learning algorithms, and data storage and retrieval to allow you to build flexible chatbots.
You can build an industry-specific chatbot by training it with relevant data. Additionally, the chatbot will remember user responses and continue building its internal graph structure to improve the responses that it can give.
### Attention

While ChatterBot is still a popular open source solution for building a chatbot in Python, it hasn’t been actively maintained for a while and has therefore accumulated a significant number of issues.

There are multiple forks of the project that implement fixes and updates to the existing codebase, but you’ll have to personally pick the fork that implements the solution you’re looking for and then install it directly from GitHub. A fork might also come with additional installation instructions.

To get started, however, you won’t use a fork. Instead, you’ll use a specific pinned version of the library, as distributed on PyPI. You’ll find more information about installing ChatterBot in step one.


## Prerequsites

Before you get started, make sure that you have a Python version available that works for this ChatterBot project. What version of Python you need depends on your operating system:

### Windows
  You need to use a Python version below 3.8 to successfully work with the recommended version of ChatterBot in this tutorial. You can install Python 3.7.9 using pyenv-win.
### Linux
  You should be able to run the project on Ubuntu Linux with a variety of Python versions. However, if you bump into any issues, then you can try to install Python 3.7.9, for example using pyenv.
### Mac OS
  You can run the project with a variety of Python versions. The chatbot was built and tested with Python 3.10.7 but should also run with older Python versions.

If you’ve installed the right Python version for your operating system, then you’re ready to get started.

## Step 1: Create a Chatbot Using Python ChatterBot
In this step, you’ll set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. You’ll also create a working command-line chatbot that can reply to you—but it won’t have very interesting replies for you yet.

To get started with your chatbot project, create and activate a virtual environment, then install chatterbot and pytz:
### Windows

  ```
  PS> python -m venv venv
  PS> venv\Scripts\activate
 (venv) PS> python -m pip install chatterbot==1.0.4 pytz
 ```
 ### Linux & Mac OS
 ```
 $ python -m venv venv
 $ source venv/bin/activate
 (venv) $ python -m pip install chatterbot==1.0.4 pytz
```
 
 Running these commands in your terminal application installs ChatterBot and its dependencies into a new Python virtual environment.
 After the installation is complete, running <code>python -m pip freeze </code> should bring up list of installed dependencies that’s similar to what you can find in the provided code’s <code>requirements.txt</code> file.
 
 With the installation out of the way, and ignoring some of the issues that the library currently has, you’re ready to get started! Create a new Python file, call it bot.py, and add the code that you need to get a basic chatbot up and running:
